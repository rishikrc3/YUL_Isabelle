Formalizing Yul Storage Semantics in Isabelle/HOL
This repository contains a formalization of basic Yul storage behavior using the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant. Yul is an intermediate language used for low-level smart contract development in the Ethereum ecosystem. This project focuses on defining and verifying how SSTORE and SLOAD work over a simplified storage model.
